# Implementation status — H04d staging rehearsal

Living cut ledger. Status reflects committed implementation and evidence, not
production readiness. Source of scope: [stabilization plan](../audit/PLAN-DE-ACCION.md),
[H04d runbook](PR-08-H04D-STAGING-REHEARSAL-RUNBOOK.md), and
[H04d.4 evidence contract and addendum](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md).

## Completed cuts

| Cut | Status and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| H04d.1 — isolated runtime controls | Complete at `1e1f912` (`feat(staging): enforce isolated runtime controls`). Runtime identity, auth/session, AI/OCR, notifications, and cron controls are covered by the [runtime isolation contract](PR-09-H04D1-RUNTIME-ISOLATION-CONTRACT.md). Flags remain off; this does not enable traffic. |
| H04d.2 — provider rehearsal | Complete at `0ab71de` (`docs(staging): record provider rehearsal evidence`). The [provider record](PR-10-H04D2-PROVIDER-EVIDENCE.md) documents beta Vercel/Turso/Telegram metadata, the empty beta webhook, and verified backup/restore metadata. It establishes distinct beta resources, not complete production isolation. |
| H04d.3 — local migration rehearsal | Complete at `80286a0`, with production-identity evidence corrected at `87a69c1`. The [local rehearsal record](PR-11-H04D3-LOCAL-MIGRATION-REHEARSAL.md) reports independent local A/B copies, canonical migration fingerprint, idempotent rerun, and clean before/after comparison. No remote DB was migrated. |
| H04d.4a — isolation evidence tooling | Complete at `1ee9515` (`feat(staging): harden isolation evidence`). Adds the local secret fingerprint helper and isolation policy checks; see the [evidence contract](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md). A local verifier result alone does not establish provider-verified isolation. |
| H04d.4b — beta secret evidence cut | Complete at `ff2bd6f` and recorded at `646d095`. Six beta secret fingerprints and provenance receipts are local/ignored; the beta Telegram token configuration helper is at `ff2bd6f`. The addendum records the beta project/DB/bot identities and confirms no DB data/schema, deployment, webhook, or production resource change. See the [H04d.4b addendum](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md#addendum-de-cierre-h04d4b--23092026). |
| H04d.4c — local manifest consistency | Implemented locally with ignored manifests and a generator; the verifier returns `ok: true`, `localManifestConsistent: true`, `isolationVerified: false`. On 24/09 the operator reported the helper's `getMe`/`getWebhookInfo` output matching the canonical production bot ID, username and webhook URL; Codex has not independently queried production. See the [H04d.4c addendum](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md#addendum-de-implementación-h04d4c--23092026). |
| H04d.4d — beta provider reconciliation/configuration | Complete for beta-only setup, 25/09/2026: the published branch has eight branch-scoped Preview controls, the beta hostname is assigned, and the project remains build-paused (`Don’t build anything`/`exit 0`) with no deployments. This does not close production identity/fingerprint comparison or authorize deploy/traffic. See the [H04d.4d addenda](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md#addendum-h04d4d-reconciliacion-beta-read-only-24092026). |
| H04d.4e — fresh beta backup/restore and read-only preflight | Local-only preflight complete, 25/09/2026: a fresh export was copied/restored outside the repository, verified with SQLite, and reconciled read-only. The beta DB is empty; the adoption plan correctly remains `blocked` and `applyAuthorized: false`. No remote migration or deployment. See the [H04d.4e addendum](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md#addendum-h04d4e-backup-restauracion-y-preflight-local-25092026). |
| H04d.4f — repetir bootstrap canónico en copias locales | Complete, 25/09/2026: independent A/B copies from the fresh beta export reached the canonical schema fingerprint; A's before/after reconciliation returned `ok: true`, B's second migration applied zero migrations, and both inspections had no pending migrations, drift, conflicts, or FK violations. Evidence remains in a permission-restricted temporary directory outside the repository. This validates only the empty-DB bootstrap mechanism; it does not authorize a remote schema write. |
| H04d.4g — bootstrap canónico en Turso beta | Complete, 26/09/2026, with specific operator authorization: the nine migrations selected by the verified Hermes manifest were applied to the exact beta DB ID in individual transactions. A fresh post-migration export/restore passed integrity; the local inspector reports `canonical`, zero pending/drift/conflicts/FK violations, and an idempotent rerun applied zero migrations. Same-target before/after reconciliation returned `ok: true`, `differences: []`. No production, webhook, traffic, or deployment action. |

## Open parent gate and next cuts

H04d.4 is not closed. The two ignored manifests now exist and pass the local
verifier, but this result is a consistent declaration, not verified provider
state. The production Telegram bot ID/username/webhook are supported by the
operator-reported output of the local read-only helper, not an independent
Codex provider query. Production secret
fingerprints remain `null`; no production secret needs to be read or rotated.
The versioned host denylist and six beta fingerprints/provenance are included
as defined by the [contract](PR-12-H04D4-ISOLATION-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT.md).

The beta numeric ID `8739389202` was recorded in H04d.2; its webhook was empty
at that inspection and must be rechecked before any remote activity. The local
helper supports user-operated, read-only `getMe`/`getWebhookInfo` capture with
token stdin and whitelisted output. H04d.4c's local consistency work is done;
provider reconciliation remains an open parent gate.

The beta-only Preview configuration is present and verified for
`codex/h04d-staging-rehearsal`; a fresh environment listing still shows the
eight branch-scoped Preview bindings without exposing values. The Vercel
project’s Ignored Build Step remains “Don’t build anything” (`exit 0`), and its
deployment list is empty. The operator authorized only schema initialization
in the exact beta DB; H04d.4g applied it and verified its canonical fingerprint
from a fresh export/restore. The database now has the canonical schema but no
application traffic or deployment has been started. Production metadata and
fingerprint comparison remain unavailable, so `isolationVerified` stays false.
The beta webhook must be checked read-only immediately before any authorized
traffic. Deployment, webhook configuration and traffic remain separate gates.

Subsequent remote rehearsal gates follow the [runbook](PR-08-H04D-STAGING-REHEARSAL-RUNBOOK.md):

1. The empty-beta bootstrap is complete and backed up. Keep the custom Hermes
   migration manifest/ledger as the only migration path for this DB until the
   two-entry legacy Drizzle journal is reconciled in a separate local cut; do
   not run `drizzle-kit migrate` against beta in the interim.
2. Before a Preview deployment, obtain its separate authorization, keep the
   ignored-build setting in place until then, and run the branch's quality
   gates. A Git push by itself must not publish a build.
3. Before any Telegram traffic, obtain separate webhook/traffic authorization,
   freshly verify the beta bot webhook read-only, and use synthetic staging
   users/chats only. Enable inbox, outbox, then worker in separately observed
   steps, reconciling after each; operational rollback disables worker, outbox,
   inbox in that order. Never reverse schema/data or restore over an active DB.
4. Keep the production reference read-only. Do not claim full isolation until
   the open provider-identity evidence is addressed without reading or rotating
   production secrets by inference.

ACT-03 (runtime, Jest, lint, and mandatory CI) is **in progress in a separate
workstream**. Its compatible dependency-security subcut is complete locally:
Next.js and four transitive dependency families were patched, full local gates
passed, and the audit dropped from 10 to 5 findings. A subsequent local XLSX
writer cut replaced the high-risk `xlsx` package without changing the export
response or CSV path; the runtime audit now reports zero findings and the full
audit reports four moderate Drizzle tooling-chain findings. See the
[dependency contract](ACT-03-DEPENDENCY-SECURITY-CONTRACT.md) and
[XLSX writer contract](XLSX-EXPORT-WRITER.md). Neither ACT-03 as a whole nor
all dependency remediation is claimed complete. The isolated build
workaround at `e51f313` (`fix(build): pin isolated production build to webpack`)
is an independent quality gate: it addresses the Next.js/Turbopack build
failure, and does not close ACT-03 or any H04d isolation/rehearsal gate.

A bounded Drizzle Kit tooling assessment is documented in the
[toolchain security contract](DRIZZLE-TOOLCHAIN-SECURITY-CONTRACT.md). Its four
moderate findings come from the dev-only `drizzle-kit` -> `@esbuild-kit` ->
`esbuild` chain. A global override was rejected because it conflicted with
other consumers' peer ranges; package files were restored. A subsequent
remediation cut needs a supported replacement or a scoped compatibility proof
against disposable local migration generation and generated-SQL comparison.
Do not force npm's breaking downgrade or alter the canonical migration runner
merely to reduce an audit count. This assessment does not close ACT-03 or
substitute for H04d.4c's provider-identity gate.

## Scope boundary for this cut

This documentation cut makes no production or beta DB data/schema changes and
no deployment, webhook, traffic, or provider configuration changes. No
production secret values are needed for the open identity gate. H04d remains a
preparation/rehearsal track; it is not a production release authorization.
